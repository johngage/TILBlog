# GitHub Actions Workflows (Optional)

This directory contains example workflows for automated deployment.

## Current Status: DISABLED

We use the simple `til_deploy.py` script for deployment (recommended).

## To Enable GitHub Actions:

1. Rename `deploy.yml.example` to `deploy.yml`
2. Update the workflow to use `_site` instead of `build`
3. Push to GitHub

Note: We recommend starting with `til_deploy.py` for simplicity and control.
