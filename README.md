# Today I Learned (TIL) Blog that may develop into a full weblog

A simple, fast TIL (Today I Learned) blog inspired by Simon Willison's design. This application allows you to publish quick notes and snippets you learn daily, organized by topics.

## Features

- Organized by topics- the topics accumulate as notes with named topics in the front matter add new topics; stored somehow in sqlite
- Full-text search
- Responsive design
- Markdown support with syntax highlighting
- Atom feed
- SQLite backend for simplicity

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Markdown
- A few other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/til.git
   cd til
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask build
   ```

## Adding Content

Create directories for your topics and add Markdown files:

```
python/
  useful-list-comprehensions.md
  debugging-with-pdb.md
flask/
  flask-blueprints.md
git/
  reset-vs-revert.md
```

Each Markdown file should start with a title (a line beginning with `#`):

```markdown
# Useful List Comprehensions in Python

Here's how to use list comprehensions effectively...
```

If no title is provided, the filename (converted to title case) will be used.

## Running the App

For development:
```
flask run --debug
```

For production, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn:
```
gunicorn app:app
```

## Deployment

This app is designed to be simple to deploy. You can deploy it to any platform that supports Python applications, such as:

- Heroku
- PythonAnywhere
- Vercel
- Fly.io
- VPS with Nginx and Gunicorn

### Example deployment with Fly.io

1. Install the Fly CLI
2. Create a `fly.toml` file
3. Deploy with `fly deploy`

## Customization

- Edit `templates/` to change the HTML structure
- Modify `static/styles.css` to change the appearance
- Update author information in `feed.py`

# New version uses static HTML generated by Flask; dynamic vs static needs explanation
# TIL Blog - Today I Learned

A collection of things I've learned, inspired by [Simon Willison's TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/).

## How It Works

This TIL blog uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Local Development**:
   - Write notes in Obsidian
   - Flask app serves dynamic content
   - SQLite database stores metadata

2. **Automated Deployment**:
   - GitHub Actions runs `build.py` to generate static HTML
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Updates automatically when you push changes

## Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tilblog.git
cd tilblog

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
python app.py
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see your TIL blog.

## Adding New TILs

1. Create a new Markdown file in your Obsidian vault
2. Add front matter with title, date, and topic
3. Write your content
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site

## File Structure

```
├── app.py              # Flask application
├── build.py            # Static site generator
├── static/             # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
├── templates/          # Jinja2 templates
└── .github/workflows/  # GitHub Actions configuration
```

## Manual Deployment

If you need to build and deploy manually:

```bash
# Generate static site
python build.py

# The static site will be in the build/ directory
# You can deploy this to any static hosting service
```
