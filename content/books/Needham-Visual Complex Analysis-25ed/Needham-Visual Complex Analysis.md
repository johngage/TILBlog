# Needham-Visual Complex Analysis

## Summary
- from the desired derivative to the geometry to the ultimately equal as $\delta\theta$ goes to zero, to multiplying to Pythagorean theorem.

$$ \frac {dT}{L d\theta}\asymp \frac {\delta T}{L \delta\theta}\asymp \frac {\delta T}{\delta s}\asymp \frac{L}{1} \implies \frac {dT}{d\theta}= L^2 = 1 + T^2
$$

## Discussion of "ultimately equal"
- Discussing tne new edition treatment of Newton's use of geometric calculus, rather than Leibnizian symbolic calculus, with the example in the Preface of the derivative of the complex quantity  $re^{i\theta}$ used in the proof, using a triangle with base 1 and vertical side T, so that T = $tan (\theta)$
- The symbol $\asymp$ is indeed what Needham uses for differential equality. This is a beautiful and intuitive notation that perfectly captures the geometric concept he's describing.

The symbol $\asymp$ (asymptotically equal) is quite fitting for Needham's geometric approach because:

1. **Visual intuition**: The curved lines suggest that the quantities are "approximately equal" in a limiting sense, rather than exactly equal at any finite scale.

2. **Differential relationship**: When he writes something like $dT \asymp L \cdot d\theta$, he's indicating that these quantities become equal in the differential limit - they differ by terms of higher order that vanish as $d\theta \to 0$.

3. **Geometric meaning**: This notation emphasizes that we're dealing with infinitesimal geometric relationships where the "error" in the equality becomes negligible compared to the quantities themselves.

This is exactly what we were discussing with the geometric proof of $\frac{dT}{d\theta} = 1 + T^2$. When Needham says the perpendicular distance is $L \cdot d\theta$, he might write:

$$\text{perpendicular distance} \asymp L \cdot d\theta$$

This captures the idea that for infinitesimal $d\theta$, the straight-line perpendicular distance and the arc length $L \cdot d\theta$ are differentially equal - they differ by terms of order $(d\theta)^2$ or higher, which vanish in the limit.

This notation beautifully embodies Needham's philosophy of making the geometric intuition behind calculus concepts visually and symbolically clear. It's a much more intuitive way to express infinitesimal relationships than the traditional $\epsilon$-$\delta$ formalism, while still being mathematically precise.
