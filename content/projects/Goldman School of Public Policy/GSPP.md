Today, Sunday, May 18,  the [Goldman School of Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/) graduation was [livestreamed](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/events-upcoming/event/2025-gspp-commencement). 

The audio stream and a complete transcript can be ingested in the GSPP NotebookLM, together with links to all documents linked to all participants.  

As the total "recording and linking" of this event expands, it will include the unique viewpoints of each participant, building on the common theme expressed by the keynote speaker, now the Executive Director of the Governor of California's Cabinet Secretaries.

- Thus, this specific graduation becomes a base document for the Class of 2025, to build   connections over time. 
- As each graduate arrived to receive their diploma, their picture was taken, they then crossed the stage to be congratulated by Dean [[David Wilson]] and the president of the GSPPP Alumni Association, . They then had their picture taken again against a GSPP backdrop, and joined family and friends.
- This event marks the joining of two graphs: the initial creation of their class community over the past two or three years, and the subsequent expansion into the world community, creating new links, new partnerships and initiatives, and new knowledge for the common good.
- To build this foundation, the next step is linking all papers, all research, all faculty, all Capstone projects, all readings, class work and independent work for a deeper understanding of the fabric of forming the public policy community.
