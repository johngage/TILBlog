Extend the framework for [[Fiber Optic Sensing Association]] educational content. Create low-cost demos for schools, science teachers. 
- Following the two-day meeting at UCBerkeley, June 3-4, 2025, develop a rich set of subject demonstrations: 
- Smart City fiber web: mapping extant deployment; owners, maintainers, major users; estimation of available dark fiber;
- City ordinance template: can a city require each fiber deployment--telco, comms, sensing--to provide bandwidth and sensing to the city?
- Use Berkeley, Palo Alto as a testing ground for implementation
	- Campus fiber maps created by DFOS Action Committee
	- City fiber maps created by Berkeley City Library or Public Works department.
	- 
- Work up a demo of the CSI structure: each surface becomes sensitive. 
	- Use space where everyone is standing: create orthogonal fibers in floor; fiber in chair; fiber in classroom; DAS; 
	- image of exponential drop-off of acoustic energy: f(d^2)
	- show each person's location on floor; have them tap-dance; do a wave, from back to front; dangle bare fiber from ceiling; 
	- make microphone: rectangular array? spiral; 
	- use fiber embedded in wall; discuss fastening;
	- DAS hearing aids
