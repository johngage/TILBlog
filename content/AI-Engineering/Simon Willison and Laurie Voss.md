Willison was great.[The last six months in llms](https://simonw.substack.com/p/the-last-six-months-in-llms-illustrated)

Here's 15 minutes of Laurie Voss : [Laurie Voss on GLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqB_xML1SfA)

It reminded me of Bill Joy and JINI....so here's a Claude chat on the history and future of distributed systems....followed by how photonics might change all distributed systems...use unique optical signatures in fiber.
