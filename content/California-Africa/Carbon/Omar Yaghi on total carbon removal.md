# [[Omar Yaghi]] on total atmospheric carbon removal of 1,100 Gigatonnes

## Summary
- 1,100 Gigaton removal possible in under 10 years
## Details
- Elements of the calculation showing the CO2 removal rate per kilogram of MOF;
- To come: table of costs for each component of the removal process


| Process step | Location | Component |Cost|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|MOF mass | City CCenter| Encapsulated MOF | $10/kilo|
