Prof. Omar Yaghi describes the scientific basis for enabling direct atmosperic carbon removal using MOF and COF; removal of 1,100 Gigatonnes of carbon could take as little as 3.1 years, with removal sites in 706 world cities.

Dimensional analysis calculations:

$\frac {Total excess C gigatonnes}{1}\frac{kilograms}{gigatonnes}\frac{cost per kilo}{kilo}$

Add material costs per gram; construction and operational costs for each Removal Center, which will vary by country and city. 

- Here is a possibility: build a World Carbon Center in the Rift Valley.  Propose this to the new company [[AIMat]]

Talk at Bakar Institute, Berkeley in April, 2025, at the AI-Climate Symposium

# [[Omar Yaghi]] on total atmospheric carbon removal of 1,100 Gigatonnes

## Summary
- 1,100 Gigaton removal possible in under 10 years
## Details
- Elements of the calculation showing the CO2 removal rate per kilogram of MOF;
- To come: table of costs for each component of the removal process


| Process step | Location | Component |Cost|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|MOF mass | City CCenter| Encapsulated MOF | $10/kilo|
