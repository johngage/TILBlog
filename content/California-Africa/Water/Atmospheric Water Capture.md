For [[Turkana]] ,[[West Pokot]], [[Kibera]] : build HH water capture at near-zero energy cost.
- can [[COF]] and [[Atmospheric Water Capture]] be a game-changer? At what material and construction costs?

- Energy cost for 20 cycle per day water capture
- Energy cost for pumping and storage
- Energy cost for transport of water to point of use

## What I Learned
- There are existing Kenyan companies operating in [[Turkana]], primarily on atmospheric carbon capture, using geothermal energy. 
- Can we twin water capture?
